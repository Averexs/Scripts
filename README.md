# Scripts

A few scripts that i've written to help install docker quickly on Debian and Ubuntu.


Debian:

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Averexs/Scripts/main/debian-docker-install.sh -o debian-docker-install.sh

bash debian-docker-install.sh

 

 

Ubuntu:

sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Averexs/Scripts/main/ubuntu-docker-install.sh -o ubuntu-docker-install.sh

sudo bash ubuntu-docker-install.sh
